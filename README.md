# BLDC-Motor-Controller
Year 2 UROP conducted by Prateek Wagle and supervised by Dr Adrià Junyent-Ferré which looks at developing a motor controller based upon Space Vector Pulse-Width Modulation (SVPWM) for a BLDC motor using a TI Delfino F28379D Launchpad and a Boostxl-drv8305. The entire design was implemented using MATLAB Simulink exclusively, with relevant coders needed to programme the evaluation board.

IMPORTANT:

Check all relevant packages are downloaded. Embedded Coder, Embedded for C2000, Simulink Coder toolboxes are required for Simulink.
CCStudio, controlSUITE are required 3rd party software.
